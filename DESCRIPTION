Description: This is a set of functions I have been using in my various analyses
             in the El-Sayed laboratory. The set of tasks included herein run a
             spectrum from preprocessing count-tables from RNAseq-like data,
             through differential expression analyses, to post-processing tasks
             like gene ontology enrichment.  Along the way, these function seek
             to make plotting analyses consistent, provide multiple entry-points
             to the various tools, and handle corner cases which are not
             flexibly handled by the packages this is based upon.
