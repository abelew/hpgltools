Description: This is a set of functions I have been using in my various
    analyses in the El-Sayed laboratory. The set of tasks included herein run a spectrum from
    preprocessing count-tables from RNAseq-like data, through differential expression analyses, to
    post-processing tasks like gene ontology enrichment.  Along the way, these function seek to make
    plotting analyses consistent, provide multiple entry-points to the various tools, and handle
    corner cases which are not flexibly handled by the packages this is based upon.
