\usage{
binary_paiwise(...)
}
\description{
The thing I want to do which I presume will be of use to Zhezhen is
to have a variant of this which takes the list of interesting
contrasts and only performs them rather than my default of doing
all possible pairwise contrasts.  I think that will only require a
little logic in make_contrasts to skip contrasts not in the list of
interest.
