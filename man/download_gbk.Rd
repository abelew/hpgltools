\title{A genbank accession downloader scurrilously stolen from ape.}
\usage{
download_gbk(accessions = "AE009949", write = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{accessions}{An accession -- actually a set of them.}

\item{write}{Write the files?  Otherwise return a list of the strings}
}
\value{
A list containing the number of files downloaded and the character strings acquired.
}
\description{
This takes and downloads genbank accessions.
}
\details{
Tested in test_40ann_biomartgenbank.R
In this function I stole the same functionality from the ape package and set
a few defaults so that it hopefully fails less often.
