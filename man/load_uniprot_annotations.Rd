}
\arguments{
\item{accession}{Which accession to grab?}

\item{species}{Or perhaps species?}

\item{taxonomy}{Query for a specific taxonomy ID rather than species/accession?}

}
\value{
A filename/accession tuple.

\description{
Uniprot is an astonishing resource, but man is it a pain to use.  Hopefully
this function will help.  It takes either a uniprot accession, taxonomy ID,
or species name and does its best to find the appropriate uniprot data.  This
is therefore primarily used by load_uniprot_annotations().
