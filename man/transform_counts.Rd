\title{Perform a simple transformation of a count table (log2)}
\usage{
transform_counts(
  count_table,
  design = NULL,
  method = "raw",
  base = NULL,
  model_fstring = "~ 0 + condition + batch",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_table}{Matrix of count data}

\item{design}{Sometimes the experimental design is also required.}

\item{method}{Type of transformation to perform: log2/log10/log.}

\item{base}{Other log scales?}

\item{model_fstring}{Formula describing the model of interest.}

\item{...}{Options I might pass from other functions are dropped into
arglist.}
}
\value{
dataframe of transformed counts.
}
\description{
the add argument is only important if the data was previously cpm'd because
that does a +1, thus this will avoid a double+1 on the data.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 filtered_table = transform_counts(count_table, transform='log2', converted='cpm')
}
