\title{A single place to extract count tables from a set of surrogate variables.}
\usage{
counts_from_surrogates(
  data,
  adjust = NULL,
  design = NULL,
  method = "ruv",
  model_fstring = "~ 0 + condition + batch",
  matrix_scale = "linear",
  return_scale = "linear",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Original count table, may be an expt/expressionset or df/matrix.}

\item{adjust}{Surrogates with which to adjust the data.}

\item{design}{Experimental design if it is not included in the expressionset.}

\item{method}{Which methodology to follow, ideally these agree but
that seems untrue.}

\item{model_fstring}{Formula string describing the statistical
model of interest.}

\item{matrix_scale}{Was the input for the surrogate estimator on a
log or linear scale?}

\item{return_scale}{Does one want the output linear or log?}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to downstream functions.}
}
\value{
A data frame of adjusted counts.
}
\description{
Given an initial set of counts and a series of surrogates, what would the
resulting count table look like? Hopefully this function answers that
question.
