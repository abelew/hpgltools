\usage{
hpgl_volcano_plot(toptable_data, tooltip_data = NULL, gvis_filename = NULL,
  fc_cutoff = 0.8, p_cutoff = 0.05, size = 2, alpha = 0.6, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{toptable_data}{Dataframe from limma's toptable which includes log(fold change) and an
adjusted p-value.}

\item{tooltip_data}{Df of tooltip information for gvis.}

\item{gvis_filename}{Filename to write a fancy html graph.}

\item{fc_cutoff}{Cutoff defining the minimum/maximum fold change for interesting.  This is log,
so I went with +/- 0.8 mostly arbitrarily as the default.}

\item{p_cutoff}{Cutoff defining significant from not.}

\item{size}{How big are the dots?}

\item{alpha}{How transparent to make the dots.}

\item{...}{I love parameters!}
}
\value{
Ggplot2 volcano scatter plot.  This is defined as the -log10(p-value) with respect to
    log(fold change).  The cutoff values are delineated with lines and mark the boundaries
    between 'significant' and not.  This will make a fun clicky googleVis graph if requested.
}
\description{
Volcano plots and MA plots provide quick an easy methods to view the set of (in)significantly
differentially expressed genes.

\examples{
\dontrun{
 hpgl_volcano_plot(toptable_data, gvis_filename="html/fun_ma_plot.html")
## Currently this assumes that a variant of toptable was used which
## gives adjusted p-values.  This is not always the case and I should
## check for that, but I have not yet.
