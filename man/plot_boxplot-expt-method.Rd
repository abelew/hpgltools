\item{order}{Set the order of boxen.}

\item{violin}{Print this as a violin rather than a just box/whiskers?}

\description{
Boxplots and density plots provide complementary views of data distributions.
The general idea is that if the box for one sample is significantly shifted
from the others, then it is likely an outlier in the same way a density plot
shifted is an outlier.
