\arguments{
\item{input}{ExpressionSet}

\item{fun}{mean or median}

\item{fact}{Which factor to slice/dice the data?}

\item{row_label}{Label the rows?}

\item{plot_title}{Title for the plot}

\item{Rowv}{Row vs (yeah I forgot what this does.)}

\item{Colv}{Col vs}

\item{label_chars}{Maximum number of characters in the sample IDs.}

\item{dendrogram}{Make a tree of the samples?}

\item{min_delta}{Minimum delta value for filtering}

\item{x_factor}{When plotting two factors against each other, which is x?}

\item{y_factor}{When plotting two factors against each other, which is y?}

\item{min_cvsd}{Include only those with a minimal CV?}

\item{cv_min}{Minimum cv to examine (I think this should be slightly lower)}

\item{cv_max}{Maximum cV to examine (I think this should be limited to ~ 0.7?)}

\item{remove_equal}{Filter uninteresting genes.}
