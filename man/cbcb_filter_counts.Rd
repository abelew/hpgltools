\title{\code{cbcb_filter_counts()}  Filter low-count genes from a data set.}
\usage{
cbcb_filter_counts(count_table, threshold = 2, min_samples = 2,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_table}{a data frame of (pseudo)counts by sample.}

\item{threshold}{default=2  lower threshold of counts for each gene.}

\item{min_samples}{default=2   minimum number of samples}

\item{verbose}{default=FALSE  if set to true, prints number of genes removed and remaining.}
}
\value{
dataframe of counts without the low-count genes
}
\description{
This was a function written by Kwame Okrah and perhaps also Laura Dillon to remove low-count genes.  It drops genes based on a threshold and number of samples.
