\title{Filter low-count genes from a data set using cpm data and a threshold.}
\usage{
cbcb_filter_counts(count_table, threshold = 2, min_samples = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_table}{Data frame of (pseudo)counts by sample.}

\item{threshold}{Lower threshold of counts for each gene.}

\item{min_samples}{Minimum number of samples.}
}
\value{
Dataframe of counts without the low-count genes.
}
\description{
This was a function written by Kwame Okrah and perhaps also Laura Dillon to remove low-count
genes.  It drops genes based on a cpm threshold and number of samples.
