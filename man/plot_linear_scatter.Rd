\value{
List including a ggplot2 scatter plot and some histograms.  This plot
 provides a "bird's eye" view of two data sets.  This plot assumes a
 (potential) linear correlation between the data, so it calculates the
 correlation between them.  It then calculates and plots a robust linear
 model of the data using an 'SMDM' estimator (which I don't remember how to
 describe, just that the document I was reading said it is good).  The
 median/mad of each axis is calculated and plotted as well.  The distance
 from the linear model is finally used to color the dots on the plot.
 Histograms of each axis are plotted separately and then together under a
 single cdf to allow tests of distribution similarity.  This will make a fun
 clicky googleVis graph if requested.
