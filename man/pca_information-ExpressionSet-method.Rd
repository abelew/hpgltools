\arguments{
\item{colors_chosen}{Colors to use when comparing fstats etc.}

\item{input_design}{Dataframe describing the experimental design, containing
columns with useful information like the conditions, batches, number of
cells, whatever...}

\item{num_components}{Number of principle components to compare the design
factors against. If left null, it will query the same number of components
as factors asked for.}
