\title{Make sure that clusterProfiler is ready to run.}
\usage{
check_clusterprofiler(gff = "test.gff", goids_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gff}{Ggff file containing annotation data (gene lengths).}

\item{goids_df}{Data frame of gene IDs and GO ontologies 1:1, other columns are ignored.}
}
\value{
GO2EG data structure created, probably don't save this, it is entirely too big.
}
\description{
Many of our ontology searches are using non-supported organisms.  These need to have a
geneTable.rda file in place which maps the gene IDs to GO IDs.  This function checks for that
file and attempts to set it up if it is not found.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 go2eg <- check_clusterprofiler(gff, goids_df)
 rm(go2eg)
}
