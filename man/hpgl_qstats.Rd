\title{A hacked copy of Kwame's qsmooth/qstats code}
\usage{
hpgl_qstats(data, groups, refType = "mean", groupLoc = "mean",
  window = 99)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the initial count data}

\item{groups}{the experimental conditions as a factor}

\item{refType}{(or median) the method to separate groups}

\item{groupLoc}{I don't remember}

\item{window}{window for basking}
}
\value{
new data
}
\description{
I made a couple small changes to Kwame's qstats() function to make
it not fail when on corner-cases.  I sent him a diff, but haven't
checked to see if it was useful yet.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
qstatted <- hpgl_qstats(data, conditions)
}
