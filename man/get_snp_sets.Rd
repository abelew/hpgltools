\title{Create all possible sets of variants by sample (types).}
\usage{
get_snp_sets(
  snp_expt,
  factor = "pathogenstrain",
  stringency = NULL,
  do_save = FALSE,
  savefile = "variants.rda",
  proportion = 0.9
)
}
\arguments{
\item{snp_expt}{Expressionset of variants.}

\item{factor}{Use this metadata factor to split the data.}

\item{stringency}{Allow for some wiggle room in the calls.}

\item{do_save}{Save the results to an rda fil.}

\item{savefile}{This is redundant with do_save.}

\item{proportion}{Used with stringency to finetune the calls.}
}
\value{
A funky list by chromosome containing:  'medians', the median number
  of hits / position by sample type; 'possibilities', the;
 'intersections', the groupings as detected by Vennerable;
 'chr_data', the raw data; 'set_names', a character list of the actual names
 of the groupings; 'invert_names', the opposite of set_names which is to say
 the names of groups which do _not_ include samples x,y,z; 'density', a list
 of snp densities with respect to chromosomes.  Note that this last one is
 approximate as I just calculate with the largest chromosome position
 number, not the explicit number of nucleotides in the chromosome.
}
\description{
I like this function.  It generates an exhaustive catalog of the snps by
chromosome for all the various categories as defined by factor.

\examples{
  \dontrun{
 expt <- create_expt(metadata, gene_information)
 snp_expt <- count_expt_snps(expt)
 snp_sets <- get_snp_sets(snp_expt, factor = "condition")
 ## This assumes a column in the metadata for the expt named 'condition'.
