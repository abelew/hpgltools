\alias{write_de_table}
\title{Writes out the results of a single pairwise comparison.}
\usage{
write_de_table(
  data,
  type = "limma",
  coef = NULL,
  table_type = "contrasts",
  excel = "de_table.xlsx",
  n = 0,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Output from results().}

\item{type}{Which DE tool to write.}

\item{excel}{Filename into which to save the xlsx data.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed downstream, dumped into arglist and passed,
notably the number of genes (n), the coefficient column (coef)}
}
\value{
List of data frames comprising the toptable output for each
 coefficient, I also added a qvalue entry to these toptable() outputs.
}
\description{
However, this will do a couple of things to make one's life easier:
1.  Make a list of the output, one element for each comparison of the
    contrast matrix.
2.  Write out the results() output for them in separate sheets in excel.
3.  Since I have been using qvalues a lot for other stuff, add a column.

\details{
Tested in test_24deseq.R
Rewritten in 2016-12 looking to simplify combine_de_tables().  That function
is far too big, this should become a template for that.
