}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Experiment to try plotting.}

\item{type}{What comparison method to use on the data (distance or
correlation)?}

\item{method}{What distance/correlation method to perform?}

\item{annot_columns}{Set of columns to include as terminal columns
next to the heatmap.}

\item{annot_rows}{Set of columns to include as terminal rows below the heatmap.}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff used to define color changes in the annotated clustering.}

\item{cluster_colors}{Choose colors for the clustering?}

\item{scale}{Scale the heatmap colors?}

\item{cluster_width}{How much space to include between clustering?}

\item{cluster_function}{Choose an alternate clustering function than hclust()?}

\item{heatmap_colors}{Choose your own heatmap cluster palette?}
}
\value{
List containing the returned heatmap along with some
 parameters used to create it.

\description{
Heatplus is an interesting tool, I have a few examples of using it and intend
to include them here.
