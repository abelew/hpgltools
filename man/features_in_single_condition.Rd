\title{I want an easy way to answer the question: what features are in only condition x?}
\usage{
features_in_single_condition(
  expt,
  cutoff = 2,
  factor = "condition",
  chosen = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expt}{An experiment to query.}

\item{cutoff}{What is the minimum number of counts required to define
'included.'}

\item{factor}{What metadata factor to query?}

\item{chosen}{Either choose a subset or all conditions to query.}
}
\value{
A set of features.
}
\description{
The answer to this lies in a combination of subset_expt() and
features_greater_than().
