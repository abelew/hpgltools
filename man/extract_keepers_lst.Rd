\arguments{
\item{extracted}{Tables extracted from the all_pairwise data.}

\item{keepers}{In this case, one may assume either NULL or 'all'.}

\item{table_names}{The set of tables produced by all_pairwise().}

\item{all_coefficients}{The set of all experimental conditions in the
experimental metadata.}

\item{limma}{The limma data from all_pairwise().}

\item{edger}{The edger data from all_pairwise().}

\item{ebseq}{The ebseq data from all_pairwise().}

\item{deseq}{The deseq data from all_pairwise().}

\item{basic}{The basic data from all_pairwise().}

\item{adjp}{Pull out the adjusted p-values from the data?}

\item{annot_df}{What annotations should be added to the table?}

\item{include_deseq}{Whether or not to include the deseq data.}

\item{include_edger}{Whether or not to include the edger data.}

\item{include_ebseq}{Whether or not to include the ebseq data.}

\item{include_limma}{Whether or not to include the limma data.}

\item{include_basic}{Whether or not to include the basic data.}

\item{excludes}{Set of genes to exclude.}

\item{padj_type}{Choose a specific p adjustment.}

\item{loess}{Add a loess to plots?}

\item{lfc_cutoff}{Passed for volcano/MA plots.}

\item{p_cutoff}{Passed for volcano/MA plots.}

\description{
This is the most interesting of the extract_keeper functions.  It must check
that the numerators and denominators match the desired contrast and flip the
signs in the logFCs when appropriate.
