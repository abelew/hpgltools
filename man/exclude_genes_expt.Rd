\title{Exclude some genes given a pattern match}
\usage{
exclude_genes_expt(expt, column = "txtype", method = "remove",
  ids = NULL, patterns = c("snRNA", "tRNA", "rRNA"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{expt}{Expressionset containing expt object.}

\item{column}{fData column to use for subsetting.}

\item{method}{Either remove explicit rows, or keep them.}

\item{ids}{Specific IDs to exclude.}

\item{patterns}{Character list of patterns to remove/keep}

\item{...}{Extra arguments are passed to arglist, currently unused.}
}
\value{
A smaller expt
}
\description{
Because I am too lazy to remember that expressionsets use matrix subsets for
gene and sample.  Also those methods lead to shenanigans when I want to know
what happened to the data over the course of the subset.
