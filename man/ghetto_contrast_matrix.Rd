\title{I rather like makeContrasts() from limma.  I troubled me to have to manually
create a contrast matrix when using MSstats.  It turns out it troubled me for
good reason because I managed to reverse my damn terms and end up with the
opposite contrasts of what I intended.  Ergo this function.}
\usage{
ghetto_contrast_matrix(numerators, denominators)
}
\arguments{
\item{numerators}{Character list of conditions which are the numerators of a
series of a/b comparisons.}

\item{denominators}{Character list of conditions which are the denominators of a
series of a/b comparisons.}
}
\value{
Contrast matrix
}
\description{
feed ghetto_contrast_matrix() a series of numerators and denominators names
after the conditions of interest in an experiment and it returns a contrast
matrix in a format acceptable to MSstats (and other similar tools).
}
