\title{Extract annotation information from a gff file into an irange object.}
\usage{
gff2irange(gff, type = NULL)

\arguments{
\item{gff}{Gff filename.}

\item{type}{Subset to extract.}
}
\value{
Iranges! (useful for getSeq().)
}
\description{
Try to make import.gff a little more robust; I acquire (hopefully) valid gff
files from various sources: yeastgenome.org, microbesonline, tritrypdb, ucsc,
ncbi. To my eyes, they all look like reasonably good gff3 files, but some of
them must be loaded with import.gff2, import.gff3, etc.  That is super
annoying. Also, I pretty much always just do as.data.frame() when I get
something valid from rtracklayer, so this does that for me, I have another
function which returns the iranges etc.  This function wraps
import.gff/import.gff3/import.gff2 calls in try() because sometimes those
functions fail in unpredictable ways.
}
\details{
This is essentially load_gff_annotations(), but returns data suitable for
getSet()  This is another place which should be revisited for improvements
via mcols().  Check snp.r. for ideas.
