\usage{
hpgl_pathview(path_data, indir = "pathview_in", outdir = "pathview",
  pathway = "all", species = "lma", string_from = "LmjF",
  string_to = "LMJF", suffix = "_colored", second_from = NULL,
  second_to = NULL, verbose = FALSE, filenames = "id")
}
\arguments{
\item{path_data}{some differentially expressed genes}

\item{indir}{A directory into which the unmodified kegg images will be downloaded (or already exist).}

\item{outdir}{A directory which will contain the colored images.}

\item{pathway}{Perform the coloring for a specific pathway?}

\item{species}{The kegg identifier for the species of interest.}

\item{string_from}{for renaming kegg categories}

\item{string_to}{for renaming kegg categories}

\item{suffix}{for renaming finished files}

\item{second_from}{sometimes jsut one regex isnt enough}

\item{second_to}{sometimes just one regex isnt enough}

\item{verbose}{talk more}

\item{filenames}{name the final files by id or name?}
}
\value{
A list of some information for every KEGG pathway downloaded/examined.  This information includes:
  a. The filename of the final image for each pathway.
  b. The number of genes which were found in each pathway image.
  c. The number of genes in the 'up' category
  d. The number of genes in the 'down' category
