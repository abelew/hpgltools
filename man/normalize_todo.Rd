\usage{
normalize_todo(expt, todo = list())
}

\item{expt}{Input data}

\item{todo}{List of tasks to perform.}

This function is ideally should provide a simpler and more capable
version of normalize_expt. I also want to move everything to using
summarizedExperiments and this simpler method provides an
opportunity.
